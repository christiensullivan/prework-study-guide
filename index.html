          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The body element contains visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>Within the body element, several tags are used to order information in a way that reads well to the user</li>
          <li>HTML itself is largely used to structure webpages in ways that make them coherent to both browser and user, but does not add any style or logic to the page.</li>
          <li>The ways it does this is by employing headers, sections, images, and other ordinal devices to give the page a skeleton off which to build a fuller "body" (hehehe).</li>

          <li>To add modified files to the branch, you'll use the "git add" command, followed by the file name, or "-A" if you're looking to add all files from a directory</li>
