          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The body element contains visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>Within the body element, several tags are used to order information in a way that reads well to the user</li>
          <li>HTML itself is largely used to structure webpages in ways that make them coherent to both browser and user, but does not add any style or logic to the page.</li>
          <li>The ways it does this is by employing headers, sections, images, and other ordinal devices to give the page a skeleton off which to build a fuller "body" (hehehe).</li>

          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>CSS is used to ass style to HTML sites either by <b>inline CSS</b> (writing in style to an existing piece of HTML code), <b>internal style sheets</b> (in which rules for style are written into the "head" element of a page), or most commonly an <b>external style sheet</b> that holds the style rules and is linked to in the "head" element.</li>

          <li>To check what branch you're working on, type "git status" into the CLI</li>
          <li>To start a new branch, type "git checkout -b [your branch name here]" into the CLI </li>
          <li>The "git checkout" command is used to move between branches, and "-b" is used to create a new branch</li>
          <li>To add modified files to the branch, you'll use the "git add" command, followed by the file name, or "-A" if you're looking to add all files from a directory</li>
          <li>Using the "-m" command assogit ciates a message with any commit you make</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Enter your JavaScript notes here</li>
          <li>JavaScript is a programming language that uses logical statements to create functions and interactivity on a webpage.</li>
          <li>Unlike HTML and CSS, which use drab but otherwise simple syntax to order the appearance of information ON a webpage, JavaScript creates processes and events in order to allow users to affect the webpage themselves (within defined parameters, of course)</li>
          <li>As this is the most complex language we've looked at thus far in the pre-work, we'll be spending a lot of time on it in the BootCamp proper, so don't let it overwhelm you.  You'll have time to learn what you need as you go.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Functions are processes that are "called" by developers and user input to make sure that they're infinitely usable and controlled.</li>
