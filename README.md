# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description

This webpage was meant to be an easily locatable, helpful document for both myself and other learners who might need to draw some insight on the basics of the pre-work's main subjects: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.  This not only have me a way to dip my toe into the rudiments of web development, but also a way to record what I found as I went.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Usage

This project can be used to view a beginner's notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.  You'll find that JavaScript is running on the page by opening the console, and the functions therein can be used to both list the topics at hand and choose a random starting place for you to get rid of all the analysis paralysis that can come with starting a new project.
